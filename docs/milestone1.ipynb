    "# Introduction \n",
    "_Describe the problem the software solves and why it's important to solve that problem_\n",
    "\n",
    "Our software package, *AD-FBI*, computes gradients using the technique of automatic differentiation. Automatic differentiation is important because it is able to solve the derivatives of complex functions at low cost while maintaining accuracy and stability. Its high practicality and precision make it applicable to a wide range of tasks, such as machine learning optimization, calculating financial loss or profit, and minimizing the cost of vaccine distribution. Automatic differentiation plays a crucial role in solving these problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the technique of automatic differentiation, the two traditional computational techniques for solving differential equations are numerical differentiation and symbolic differentiation. The numerical differentiation method computes derivatives based on a finite numerical approximation which lacks stability and precision, and thus it is not ideal to be implemented in computer software. On the other hand, symbolic differentiation can become very computationally expensive as the function becomes more and more complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "The automatic differentiation technique transforms the entire computational process into a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations -- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and elementary functions. And then, it applies the chain rule on top of these elementary operations. In this way, it reduces the computational complexity that the model can reuse some of its parts computed in previous steps multiple times without re-calculating them. It keeps the same level of accuracy and precision as using symbolic differentiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our software package computes derivatives using the forward mode of auto differentiation and will later explore other extensions (different optimizer). \n",

    "* __Chain Rule__\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain Rule is the most important concept in automatic differentiation. To solve the derivatives of a composite function, we use the Chain Rule to decompose each variable in the function into elementary components and mulptily them together. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a given function $f(y(x))$, the derivative of $f$ with respect to $ x $ is the following:\n",

    "Given x = $\\begin{bmatrix} {x_1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {x_m} \\end{bmatrix}$, where $k \\in (1, 2, ..., m)$, we introduce the intermediate operations $ v $ to compute values at each elementary operation step.\n",
